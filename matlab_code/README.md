# Code for simulations of figures 3A,B; 4A,B; and 7A-C.

## How to run

Open the file with the name of the figure in Matlab:

Figure 3A and 3B -> figure3_A_and_B.m

Figure 4A -> figure4_A.m

Figure 4B -> figure4_B.m

Figure 7A and 7B -> figure7_A_and_B.m

Figure 7C -> figure7_C.m

## Files

All other files are functions or subroutines that are necessary to run the simulations.

## Questions

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the code.
