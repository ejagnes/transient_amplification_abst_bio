# Code for simulations of figures 3A,B; 4A,B; 5A; 7E-G; 8; and 9.

## How to run

Open the file with the name of the figure in Matlab:

Figure 3A and 3B -> figure3_A_and_B.m

Figure 4A -> figure4_A.m

Figure 4B -> figure4_B.m

Figure 5A - figure5_A.m

Figure 7E and 7F -> figure7_E_and_F.m

Figure 7G -> figure7_G.m

Figure 8B, 8C, 8E, and 8F (without the schematics) -> figure8.m

Figure 9C, 9D, and 9E (without the schematics) -> figure9.m

## Files

All other files are functions or subroutines that are necessary to run the simulations.
